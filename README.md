Brain tumors are a major cause of cancer death, and early diagnosis is essential for
improving patient outcomes. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a common imaging
modality used to detect brain tumors, but manual tumor segmentation is a time consuming and challenging task. The objective of this research project is to investigate
the use of the Segment Anything foundation model for automatic brain tumor detection
and segmentation. The Segment Anything foundation model is a large language model
that can be prompted to perform a variety of tasks, including image segmentation. The
proposed research project has the potential to develop a new and effective tool for brain
tumor detection and segmentation. The model can be used to improve the accuracy and
efficiency of tumor diagnosis, and it can help to save lives.
